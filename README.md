## âš¡ Hobbies

- I play a lot of games, and I do play a lot XD, you can find my steam account by [this](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198324245418). If you happen to be reading this line, I really want to put some of my recommandations here: Outer Wilds, Undertale, Superliminal, The Stanley Parable. These games, in my opinions, are the games that truely extends games to the concept of art.
- All types of music, as long as they are not the kind that hurts my ears. I also make music myself when I am free, mostly electronic music, I posted them on Netease Cloud Music, if you wanna check them out, my account is [Y.I-L.Z](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=34438656).
- Animes. I do not watch them as much as I did in earlier years but I still enjoy that style of performance. If you happen to be interested, I recently put the ones I watched on myanimelist, and my account is [here](https://myanimelist.net/profile/yilz).
- I read light novels, and I also wrote some myself (in Chinese). I uploaded some that I am satisfied with on an Chinese online platform, however basically all of them were taken down by website administrators since I put too many mature sections in my novels (well, strictly speaking, nothing I wrote was R18 stuff, but appearantly they were still too much for a Chinese website XD, idk I guess I'll take the result that most of my work disappeared from the website). Anyways, I still got a little left so here is the [website](https://book.sfacg.com/) and my account is `å¥‡å¤¸å…‹`.
